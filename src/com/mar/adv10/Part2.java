    /**
     * --- Part Two ---
     * To completely determine whether you have enough adapters,
     * you'll need to figure out how many different ways they can be arranged.
     * Every arrangement needs to connect the charging outlet to your device.
     * The previous rules about when adapters can successfully connect still apply.
     * <p>
     * The first example above (the one that starts with 16, 10, 15) supports the following arrangements:
     * <p>
     * (0), 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
     * (0), 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
     * (0), 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
     * (0), 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
     * (0), 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
     * (0), 1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
     * (0), 1, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
     * (0), 1, 4, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 19, (22)
     * (The charging outlet and your device's built-in adapter are shown in parentheses.)
     * Given the adapters from the first example, the total number of arrangements
     * that connect the charging outlet to your device is 8.
     * <p>
     * The second example above (the one that starts with 28, 33, 18) has many arrangements. Here are a few:
     * <p>
     * (0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 31,
     * 32, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, (52)
     * <p>
     * (0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 31,
     * 32, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45, 46, 47, 49, (52)
     * <p>
     * (0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 31,
     * 32, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45, 46, 48, 49, (52)
     * <p>
     * (0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 31,
     * 32, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45, 46, 49, (52)
     * <p>
     * (0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 31,
     * 32, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45, 47, 48, 49, (52)
     * <p>
     * (0), 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45,
     * 46, 48, 49, (52)
     * <p>
     * (0), 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45,
     * 46, 49, (52)
     * <p>
     * (0), 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45,
     * 47, 48, 49, (52)
     * <p>
     * (0), 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45,
     * 47, 49, (52)

     * (0), 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 45,
     * 48, 49, (52)
     * In total, this set of adapters can connect the charging outlet to your device in 19208 distinct arrangements.
     * <p>
     * You glance back down at your bag and try to remember why you brought so many adapters;
     * there must be more than a trillion valid ways to arrange them! Surely,
     * there must be an efficient way to count the arrangements.
     * <p>
     * What is the total number of distinct ways you can arrange the adapters to connect the charging outlet to your device?
